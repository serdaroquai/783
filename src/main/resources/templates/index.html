			<div class="col-md-12">this is a simple paragraph that is meant
				to be nice and easy to type which is why there will be no commas no
				periods or any capital letters so i guess this means that it cannot
				really be considered a paragraph but just a series of run on
				sentences this should help you get faster at typing as im trying not
				to use too many difficult words in it although i think that i might
				start making it hard by including some more difficult letters I'm
				typing pretty quickly so forgive me for any mistakes i think that i
				will not just tell you a story about the time i went to the zoo and
				found a monkey and a fox playing together they were so cute and i
				think that they were not supposed to be in the same cage but they
				somehow were and i loved watching them horse around forgive the pun
				well i hope that it has been highly enjoyable typing this paragraph
				and i wish you the best of luck getting the best score that you
				possibly can</div>
